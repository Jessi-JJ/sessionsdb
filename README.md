# Session DB
This was created as a project for DSA508 at SUNY Polytechnic Institute.

The dataset was created using Claude AI (Anthropic, 2025) to develop a dashboard with sufficient data for a real-life application.
The document-based dataset was uploaded to Azure using Azure CosmosDB for Mongo DB. The database and collections are properly structured and accessible online.
The dashboard visualizes important business metrics and trends extracted the `sessions` document database.
